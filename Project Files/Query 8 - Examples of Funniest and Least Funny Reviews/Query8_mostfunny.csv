"Went there for a birthday dinner and had reservations for 9 people (and 3 additional people showed up) after a grueling 2 hr wait and several drinks we finally got seated only to be told that because we had 3 extra people that we would have to split our party up and they would have to wait for a table! The manager was unwilling to work with us and so we took our party of 12 very hungry ad upset people to another Soulard Restaurant (he-hem) right down the street and had a FABULOUS dinner with EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE! Like my brother in law said, if he ran his business like BroadwayOyster ran theirs then he would be out of business ! I agree with him that it is our fault as a society for allowing this behavior to be accepted and to allow sub par customer service. That was my FIRST and LAST time at BOB for matter of sheer principle only. No matter how good their food may be, there are too many other great restaurants in The Lou to choose from that would have handled this situation much differently.  #missedopportunities

Regarding to Broadway Oyster owner :
Thanks John Johnson for giving social media a perfect example of EXACTLY what I am talking about. You clearly underestimate the power of exceptional customer service as well as the impact each customer satisfied or not, can make on a business. While I could rebuttal all your inaccuracies from your very soured response I ask myself, why? However, I will say this one thing. The couple who ""stayed behind"" as you said did no such thing. She was actually the first one to suggest we just leave but they had already ordered their food so instead of sticking your restaurant with the cost of the food they waited for their order and took it to go and met the rest of our party of 12 (not 15 as you previously mentioned) just a few minutes later for her Moms birthday dinner. The rest of your inaccuracies are really not even worth debating. I can't help to think what someone like Jon Taffer host of Bar Rescue would think of all this. Hopefully, something like this is will never be a concern.",792
"Went to dinner here with the wife and the in-laws. Extremely solid all around. Great service, classy atmosphere, and extremely delicious food. 

One word of caution.... don't get your heart set on anything on the menu until you hear the specials. There were several the night we went and they all sounded great. I had the venison and it was outstanding. The rest of my party had seafood dishes and everyone was impressed. 

The wine list was solid as well--Cab heavy like most places, but had some good selections at acceptable price points in other areas as well. 

Dessert was all winners too. It's pricey, but it should be, because it's worth it.",378
"Went to Brick's last night and it was amazing!  A true Reno gem that I highly recommend - an absolute must.  The staff is friendly and efficient, but it's truly the food that takes center stage.

Here's the lineup:

Appetizers:  Crab Cakes, Pork Belly served over Lentils, Caprese Salad

The crab cakes were fantastic, texture was just right and they didn't fall apart super easy.  We squeezed a bit of lemon and then lightly applied the sauce they were served with.  The pork belly was beyond flavorful, such a treat to eat.  The lentils were as good as any I have had, but I'm not particularly a fan.  The caprese salad was super refreshing with heirloom tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, drizzled in a perfectly balanced olive oil, with thinly sliced avocado on the side (I added freshly grated black pepper).

Entrees:  Rib Eye Steak in seasoned garlic butter with french fries and Seared Ahi Tuna with Lobster Risotto

The Rib Eye was cooked to perfection, wonderfully tender and full bodied steak flavor, and the french fries were perfectly crispy.  The ahi was was seared just enough, but not too much.  There was a sauce drizzled over it that had a nice kick to it that really complimented the fish.  The risotto was loaded with lobster and cheese which makes an even better combination than I had ever imagined.  The combination of the tuna and the risotto was true culinary perfection.

Dessert:  Bricks Belgian Chocolate Mouse

Super rich and decadent desert - I consider myself a chocolate lover, but we had to tap out less than halfway through the slice.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but perhaps a bit too rich or our blood.",375
"I don't know why I used to think Bricks was a French restaurant.  Maybe it was at one point but it is now contemporary American with seafood.  Some reviewers here seemed unhappy, but I think you have to take into consideration that this is an upscale restaurant with upscale prices.  Yes, Reno's restaurant scene has become highly competitive lately with awesome new places like Midtown Eats, Brasserie St James, Bowl, Campo, and Old Granite, in my top ten list, but if you're looking for good, old fashioned upscale eats in a very nice, upscale restaurant, this is the place to go.  I mean, if you're trying to impress a date or take one on some anniversary or birthday, it's a nicer atmosphere than say Midtown or Brasserie.  Atmosphere does count for a restaurant's overall score.  I wouldn't call the menu that innovative.  I'm thinking this is a place for more conservative, older types.  And that's fine, because every restaurnat should cater to a niche and not try to be everything for everyone.  Everyone in Reno also loves 4th Street Bistro, but I think the atmosphere there is 80's while the food is spectacular and organic.  The big problem I have here is the 80's easy listening music they pipe in with Dionne Warwick and Lionel Richie.  Oh boy.  After several songs my ears bleed.  They have a seperate bar area where you can eat solo which I like and a very attentive, professional bartender.",370
"Bricks is easily the nicest restaurant in Reno! Such a beautiful space and classy food. They gave our group the 5 star treatment!  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share - the best were the Barbecue Peppered Prawns and Baked Mushroom Caps.  I think I ate two orders of the mushrooms myself!  They were served in an Escargot plate and were stuffed with Escargot and Blue Cheese. 

Next I had a cup of their soup special which I can't remember if it was pumpkin or butternut squash - I just remember it was so delicious I forgot to share with my husband! (oops) We were supposed to be splitting the soup and the Spinach Salad.  The best part of the Spinach Salad was the warm goat cheese - so melty and creamy!  My entree was the Fettuccine Pescatore with huge chunks of lobster plus scallops and shrimp. 

Definitely a memorable meal with good friends in the Biggest Little City in the World!",369
"I'm torn about this review. Prices were steep, but I expected that. Appetizer (duck ravioli) was bland.  Husband's entree (duck as well) was good, however and my rib eye was very tender. My main reason for the three stars was service. Although it was ok timing wise (although second course took 25-30 minutes after the appetizer) the staff is just cold. No warm greetings, no smiles and when I joked with the bus boy, he acted like I didn't even talk. These people take themselves way too seriously. I would gladly pay this price for a good meal, but I have a right to expect friendly service.",361
"Since my move to Reno I have heard very good things about this restaurant, and luckily had the privilege of attending a small group presentation held at this restaurant. When arriving at this restaurant, there is simply just a black sign indicating the name. There is nothing that makes this restaurant stand out on a busy south virginia street. But, right when you enter the restaurant there is definitely a different ambiance compared to many other places in Reno.  Our tables were set in a private room with white table cloths, a perfectly set table, and low but appropriate lighting.  Our server was very friendly and quick, not even a minute passed before she greeted us and took our drink orders.  The dinner started off with a plate of jumbo prawns and another plate of mushroom, garlic, and butter escargot.  It was my first time trying escargot and the verdict is...not bad at all.  I had a spinach, walnut, and apple salad that was very fresh with a nice light vinaigrette. For my entree i selected the filet mignon with mashed potatoes, and was very surprised to see the portion for the filet mignon.  It was a lot bigger than I expected and it was cooked perfectly to my request.  After the appetizers and the salad I really had to force myself to finish my entree because I just couldn't let something that good go to waste.  But the night still was not over, for dessert...yes I know I am a fatty, but I had to try one of their desserts since everything else was so good...I selected the bread pudding with apricots, walnuts, and apples with caramel sauce.  I love caramel so I knew I was going to like it, and I did! It reminded me more of a pie than a bread pudding but it was also very good.  So I ended the night very satisfied and very full!",357
"We ended up here for a low key bachelor party dinner. If I lived in Reno, I would probably pop in here- no doubt. Love the decor, menu selection, and the bar. 

We showed up right after 9 on a Saturday. What blew me away was that they were just closing- at 9PM on a Saturday! No way a place like this should be closing on a Sat until 11-12. But I guess I am more accustomed to places in SF.

Anyway, I will come back here. Good steak and service.",357
"Tried Bricks for my husbands birthday. Everything was excellent.  We took our time and they did not try to hurry us at all. We tried the abalone as an appetizer first. Although it's pricey, it was a worthwhile splurge. The martini's were perfect ( be careful though, they are doubles!) I had a salad with grilled goat cheese that was wonderful. The pasta was the only thing I can say was just ok. Desert was great too! We would love to go back again!",353
"We've been to Bricks a few times before and enjoyed it and when we couldn't figure out what we wanted last night - Bricks had some availability slightly earlier than other establishments.

Once we got there, we were seating right away which was good since we got there early and they were busy.  

Nice table linens and the restaurant was clean.   The brass and glass combination needs to go, makes the restaurant a little dated. It was also a little too much on the bright side vs a little darker for a more intimate setting.

Regardless, we ended up ordering a bottle of Kenwood Zinfandel, the Ribeye Steak and the Driver scallops on Risotto.

Right off the bat - risotto was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.   Well done to the chef that put it together - it was awesome.   The scallops were also cooked great, seared on both sides and tender in the middle.

The steak and fries were also good.    I realized once I took my first bite that I didn't tell the waitress how I wanted my meat cooked, and she didn't ask either.    The steak I had was thinner on one side and thicker on the other.   My first few bites were of well done steak and I was a little worried, however, after a few bites I had nice medium-rare steak that tasted really good.   It was a little on the dry side and if I had to guess, they are using USDA Choice cuts, not Prime.

Regardless, it was still a good meal and we enjoyed it.  Service was very good and everyone was very nice, prompt and courteous. 

My only complaint was when we left and used the restrooms.  The wastebaskets were full and the floor of the mens room could have been cleaner.  Not the end of the world but one of those small details that should have been taken care of.

Pricing for Bricks is very reasonable for what you order.   If you decide to go with something more unique - like the Abalone (which they serve EVERY night) expect to pay for it ($70).   But all the other menu items are reasonable priced (~$20-$30 per entree).

I'd recommend Bricks to anyone looking for a quality meal out at a fine restaurant without spending too much money.",351
"So now i've had lunch as well as dinner at Bricks and it's still one of my favorite resteraunts in town! They are open for lunch i believe wed-friday. Its a good alternate to their higher price dinner menu with food that is just as excellent. For an appetizer we had mushroom caps filled with escargot and blue cheese. Very rich but very tasty. For entrees i had a grilled portabello veggie sandwich, my boyfriend had a shrimp and avocado salad and my mom had an appetizer of grilled scallops and calamari steaks. Everyone's was awesome and they were very decent portions. 2 NA drinks, an appetizer and 3 lunches was $60- very reasonable i thought considering the quality of food and service. Thanks for taking care of us Mike!",347
"I would give Brick's 4 1/2 stars if I could.  5 Stars is darn near perfection, so I have to be picky who I give that to.  Bricks came close.  We went last Thursday for my birthday, although we did not mention this.  I wanted to get a very objective idea of their service without ""tainting"" it by telling them it was my birthday.We had booked a table, and were greeted at the door by name (how did they know us?) when we walked in. That was nice.  We were shown to a beautiful booth.  The restaurant is gorgeous.  The decor is beautifully styled, modern, and soothing sort of soft metallic grays and golds.  Very pleasing to the eye.  Our waiter came quickly, and took our drink orders.  I had pelligrino and my husband had a beer, and I wonder if our not ordering wine affected the level of service we got.  The waiter, Steve, took quite a while to come back and take our food order.  We saw him acting very pleasant and chatty with several other tables as he refilled their wine glasses.  Don't get me wrong.  Our service was good, but Steve was more attentive to other tables at which he was pouring wine.  Interesting.  We ordered the mushroom caps appetizer with escargot and bleu cheese, and it was fantastic.  We had a wedge salad, which was not a wedge of iceberg lettuce, but it was layered leaves of Romaine.  It was done really nicely, though.  Bleu cheese dressing was painted on each leaf, and then stacked, and then bacon and crumbled bleu cheese were scattered over the top  - yummy.  I had the sea bass, and my husband had the seafood fettuccini.  His pasta had tons of seafood in it - loads of shrimp and other goodies.  My sea bass had crushed macadamia nuts on the top, and it was absolutely delicious.  We were very full, and decided not to have dessert.  I stopped at the restroom afterwards, to check it out, and was pleased to see a stunningly decorated, very modern and spotless restroom - nice.  We loved our meal, and will definitely go back.  They would have gotten 5 stars from me, but I felt we were taken down a notch by Steve because we did not order wine.  We still managed to spend over $100, and he could have talked us into dessert if he had tried, but , alas, he did not!",346
"Went here for my boyfriends birthday at 6pm and there was no one there. Eventually more groups came but at first it felt a little awkward being the only ones in the restaurant. But our waiter was very nice, he helped us choose a nice glass of wine to go with our dinners so that was great. My boyfriend had the special of  Elk chops which were sooo yummy and I had the risotto with scallops, which were also very delicious. Would definitely go here again!",345
"What a great dining experience.  They are open for lunch on selected days and luckily today was one of them.  Started with the manhattan style lobster chowder and so different from other places it was literally swimming with lobster including whole claw meat as opposed to the salty lobster whisperer and not one mushy potato to be found.  Awesome! The wedge was chunks of blue cheese and large pieces of bacon on really crisp lettuce as opposed to the bacon bit whisperer which also sucks. Awesome twice! The ahi salad had so much flavor we are thinking why don't we come here more often, well duh we live in Tahoe.  Seriuosly service was awesome, thank you Mike, and it was a fabulous meal from start to finish.",344
"Classiest place in Reno. I ate at the bar with family, what a bar! Loved the ambiance, polite and knowledgeable staff. My brother is a NYC man, likes the finer things and he approved of this place - it was up to his standards, it was the wow factor for Reno.The appetizers  we ornate, beautifully displayed and did I mention delicious? I will defiantly go back for lunch or dinner. It is a place to bring family, classy friends, and a date if you do that thing.",342
"Nice atmosphere, friendly service and great food. Ordered the filet and the Cabernet sauce, it was delicious. They have a great wine selection from wineries all over, nothing to commercial.",341
"Great fine dining restaurant with exceptional specials, wine selection, and service.  You must try this place!",336
"Upscale fine dining establishment with the best steaks I have found in Reno yet.  The fish is also extraordinarily good, and I *like* what they do to lamb.  Excellent onion soup and good salads too.  

This is our go-to place when we have a jones for a fine steak dinner.",333
"I only ate here once. Had the king salmon and it was excellent!! The other person I was with had the lamb. The lamb was so-so. Not bad but not awesome either.

The service was excellent. Prompt, knowledgeable and attentive. 

Ambiance was more formal than I am used to. But it was not pretentious either.

So after having one meal and sampling another I say 4 stars. I would definitely return here when visiting Reno.",332
"Overpriced and underwhelming food in a very nice atmosphere.  

My boyfriend and I went in to Lulou's for dinner on a weeknight at around 6:30.  The person at the door (who I have since learned is the owner) was not very warm or welcoming, but meh not a really big deal. Other than that, my first impression was ""Wow, what is a place like this doing in Reno?""  It is a very upscale and modern type of decor that you would expect to see in a big city.  We sat down and ordered the lobster which was served escargot-style as an appetizer.  Very good, but not anything very special... I could cut up chunks of lobster, and put them in the dish with butter and bake it.  We each got the butternut squash soup which was pretty good but again, overpriced.  I think they justified the $12 soup by putting a tablespoon of bluefish in the center of the bowl.  My boyfriend decided to order the venison, and asked our waitress to suggest a nice strong red wine to pair with the venison.  She ended up suggesting a pinot noir which was very fruit forward and awful with the venison.  In a place where you are paying about $80 per person, you would hope for a little more wine knowledge.... or at least a waitress who would ask the bartender if she wasn't sure.  The venison was spectacular tasting... tasted more like a filet than venison.  I had the seared ahi which had an avocado/wasabi puree on top.  The ahi was amazing, but again not too innovative and pretty expensive.  What really disappointed me about my entree was the fried rice which was served as a side.  It tasted like instant white rice with chunks of crab meat in it and had a fried egg on top, very bland and very disappointing.  There was also a skewer of grilled shiitake mushrooms and some greens that were both pretty good.  I ordered my own wine, had a glass of fume blanc that was good but overpriced.   Dessert was amazing!  There were about four things on the menu that I wanted to order, but we ended up splitting the brownie sundae.  It was a decadent layered creation of salted carmel ice cream, rich brownies, and toasted marshmallow.  My only complaint is that it came inside a fishbowl looking sphere that was beautiful but made it a little difficult to eat.  

I think if I ever decide to go again it will be to have a cocktail and an appetizer or dessert in their beautiful lounge.",326
