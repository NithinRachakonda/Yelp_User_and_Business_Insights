"The food was so much better than I expected. The steak cooked to perfection and the salad and sides were spot on. The best part, though, was our server Michael King. What a pro! If you want to see the consummate server/waiter in action, ask for him. I'm in the business of hospitality and this guy gets it. Period. Great evening, fantastic food and a wonderful experience. I highly recommend it!",-1
"I don't live in Indianapolis but I visit maybe like once a year and have never been down to this area and I love it over here the little area that Calvin Fletcher's is in just has a cozy feel to it. As does the coffee shop. I got a ""You and Me"" latte iced which is rose simple syrup, cinnamon and bee pollen (and coffee and milk obviously) and it was amazing! A cup of Columbian coffee is also delicious. I loved the feeling of the coffee shop and the people working there are also very nice and welcoming.",0
"Am I crazy for not being crazy about this place? Maybe, a little. But hey, we are in STL, and when it comes to bbq we have options.
I think the meat here is fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",0
"Overall this was good BBQ. Not the best I've ever had, but quite tasty. I had the combo plate with brisket and pulled pork, and my daughter had the pulled pork plate. The pulled pork was delicious. The brisket was ok, didn't think it was very tender, although flavorful. But I've had much better brisket elsewhere. The pit beans were an awesome side, but the mac and cheese was very disappointing--way too salty--you couldn't really even taste the cheese because it was so salty. Good beer selection, great service. Very long wait to get seated, but lots of places in the area to browse while you wait.
They offer 4 different sauces. I guess I liked the sweet one the best. None of them had much heat. The one that is supposed to be hot really had no heat whatsoever. Seems to me if you are offering multiple sauces that at least one should have some spice to it.
Anyhow, go for the pulled pork and the pit beans. Wish I had tried the ribs instead of the brisket.",0
"We had a girls breakfast and their estimated wait time was right on point. My son and I shared the Patriot Waffle and it was perfection! Strawberries and blueberries were sweet and fresh! The only issue was they watered down their grits too much. Maybe it was just a one-time occurrence, but I didn't appreciate it for how much they charge for a small cup of watered down grits.",0
"We went here for breakfast on 4/20/19. We went early to avoid the massive line and wait times. We were seated promptly. The food arrived in a timely manner and it was delicious and plentiful as usual. We sometimes order breakfast as takeout over the phone, pick it up and eat it at home.

My only critical comment is that the place needs to be bigger with a drive-thru pickup window for call-in orders. We often avoid dining here because of the long lines and 30 minute waits. I would think that's a good problem to have though.",0
"The food was pretty good. The service wasn't bad. The bill was alright. The appetizers are great, but my entree in particular (the halibut) was just ok. A little underwhelming.",0
"Awesome! Totally lived up to the name. I love a good salad and this place delivers. I will be back and back again. Thank you!",0
"Get their food delivered with UberEats. Download the UberEats app and enter code UE-uaduw for $10 off first order! Good wings, flatbreads, and German pretzel",0
"Their steak frites is fantastic - the fries..yum!!! And the steak is always cooked perfectly. In my opinion, this dish is the best deal at Armature Works. The bartenders are always friendly, and the selection is massive! It's pretty average prices for Armature Works. I come back all the time for the people & the food! The wine's good, too :)",0
"Went here for the first time on 9-6-19. I kept hearing about the Sicilian sandwich and needed to try it for myself. The line to order was long but it moved at a good pace. For being as busy as they are, the sandwich was ready quickly. Upon receiving the sandwich the first thought I had was how will I eat all of this. After one bite, I realized I have been depriving myself of a great sandwich. It was delicious! I ordered the sandwich with everything, though I don't know what that includes. I will say that the sandwich was gourmet style and I will be going back for the philly cheese steak sandwich.",0
"Fantastic food! Unbelievable beer.
Do not miss this brewery when you are In Santa Barbara.",0
"Great sounding menu but the teenagers running the place don't have a clue.  Very dirty. I may try it one more time.  But I've heard a lot of people with the same complaints.",0
"The bar itself is truly stunning however the service factor is what is making me leave them a poor review. The bartender on duty the night I went was frazzled, likely due to the understaffing on a busy Saturday night which led him being extremely rude. He was really irritated with me for not having an open tab and deciding to pay for my drinks individually despite the fact I was tipping him 20%. He charged me for extra drinks without my permission, and decided to  make a big production of cutting me off for spilling my drink at the bar. Whereas when one of the ""working girls"" at the bar did the same thing her drink was refilled no questions asked. The service you expect from a Four seasons is sorely lacking. It seems they can't decide if they want to be a bar for everyone or cater to an upscale clientele. I called for resolution to my issues with the manager and expressed how the service was an issue and was promised to have my extra drinks refunded which never happened. I would recommend going here when the hype wears down, go off hours and stick to one drink and leave. And to management I'd say hire a bar staff with thicker skins and deeper experience in hospitality.",0
"This was one of the most amazing brunch spots I have went to I think in Edmonton. It was very filling and so delicious!! Parking is a little difficult but there is a parade or street parking free after 6 or weekends.",0
"A great concert venue. This is the home of the Grand Ole Opry. Much smaller and more intimate than the new Opry the venue is a grand old church. The place rocks with a massive sound system. 

Ticket prices vary with performers.  I don't think there is a bad seat in the house. 

Guided backstage tours.",0
"It is a seriously poor reflection of the restaurant's management when there's no dine-in service available, pick-up customers are clogging the lobby waiting, and the cashier just shakes her head ""no"" when you reach the counter to pay for your order.

I still haven't even eaten the pizza. Wish me luck.",0
"Absolutely the best soul food restaurant I have ever been to.  Came here while staying in the city for a few days and absolutely loved it. We had great service from beginning to end, and the food was phenomenal.  I recommend this place to anyone staying in the city.",0
"I ordered two separate chicken dishes to go. The food was ready in five minutes. In both cases the chicken was undercooked and near to being raw.",0
"The 1 star rating is for the customer service or lack there of from our waitress. We went to this restaurant for breakfast because it's conveniently located at our hotel. We decided to do the breakfast buffet for $22. You get several different options of grits, ham, bacon, sausage, toast, fruit, cheeses, yogurt, granola, and juice. Also, you can have eggs and French toast made fresh. For all of that, the price wasn't too bad. The gentleman who cooked the eggs and French toast was super friendly, and the items he cooked were delicious. As for the waitress, she got us coffee and creamer, and that was it. I had to walk up to her to ask for water. She never checked in on us. I saw her sitting in a booth most of the time we were there. I had to flag down another server for coffee and water refills. The waitress finally got up from sitting around to give us the check. I wanted to write ""this tip is for the guy who actually helped us and the gentleman who cooks the eggs"", but I didn't. Definitely not worth it. Walk down the street to the Ruby Slipper. Much better everything there.",0
