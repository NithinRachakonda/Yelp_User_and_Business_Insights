# Yelp_User_and_Business_Insights
This project analyzes over 1 million Yelp user and business records to uncover trends in engagement, reviews, and performance. Using SQL and data warehousing principles, the project builds a normalized relational database and performs in-depth analysis to answer business-relevant questions.

## Project Overview
- Built a normalized schema and inserted data using SQL
- Designed an ERD and created a data dictionary
- Conducted advanced SQL-driven analysis to extract insights
- Developed visualizations and final report presentation

## Repository Structure
- `Instructions/`: Provided instructions, ERD guidance, and a report template
- `Project Files/`: All SQL scripts, queries, outputs, and visual assets are my own work
- `Data.rar`: Sample dataset used for schema creation and query validation

## Data
Due to GitHub's file size limits, only **partial data** is included here for demonstration purposes. The **full dataset (~3GB)** used in this project can be shared upon request.

## Highlights
- Designed and normalized database schema from raw Yelp datasets
- Wrote complex SQL queries to derive business insights (e.g., funniest reviews, elite user patterns, business activity trends)
- Documented schema and logic through a custom data dictionary
- Visualized findings and recommendations in a report presentation
